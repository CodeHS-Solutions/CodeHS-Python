Write your pseudocode here.

The player must have the option to keep rolling or to 
bank their points. 
    If the player keeps rolling then the program must
    do a function to get a random integer.
        If the roll is 2-6, then they get the amount of
        points rolled
        
        If the roll is 1, then they loss all of their rolled
        points.
        
    If the player decides against rolling, then their rolled
    points are converted into bank points.
    
If the player obtains over 100 points, then the game is over.
