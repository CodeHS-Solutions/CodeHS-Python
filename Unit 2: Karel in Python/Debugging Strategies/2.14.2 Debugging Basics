Question: 1
Will the following program move Karel one space, put down three tennis balls, then move forward and put down three more tennis balls?

def tennis_balls():
    for i in range(3):
        if no_balls_present():
            put_ball()
        else:
            take_ball()

move()
tennis_balls()
move()
tennis_balls()


Yes, because it is using the tennis_balls() function.


No, because the tennis_balls() function is looping the wrong number of times.


Yes, because the move() command is being called outside of the function.

Correct Answer
No, because the tennis_balls() function has an incorrect if/else statement.
