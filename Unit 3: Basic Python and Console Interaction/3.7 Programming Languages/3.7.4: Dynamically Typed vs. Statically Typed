    Dynamically typed and statically typed languages compare
and contrast due to their use of variables. They both contain
and use variables to store values. However, dynamically typed
languages allow variables to hold different types of values,
and statically typed languages must explicitly declare
and maintain the type of a variable.

An example of a dynamically typed language is Python, while
a statically typed language is Java. Both types of languages
can be better in certain scenarios.
