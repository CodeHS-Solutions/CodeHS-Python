    Compiled and interpreted languages are different because
compiled languages translates the entire code at once, while
interpreted languages translates the code per line.

    Compilers are faster in execution and can be easier to
identify bugs, but the additional steps are time-consuming.
Meanwhile, interpreters are slower in execution, are easier
to test, and are more readable.
